<meta name="twitter:description" content="I had a fancy shmancy website with wordpress, and I was very proud! Nice pentest tooling logos, badges for showing off, great header image. But besides terrible loading times, 3 hours to set up a 2min reading time blog post or hard time customizing css&hellip; none of that really showed what I was actually learning or even who I really became after entering the cybersec world.

<p>I had a fancy shmancy website with wordpress, and I was very proud! Nice pentest tooling logos, badges for showing off, great header image. But besides terrible loading times, 3 hours to set up a 2min reading time blog post or hard time customizing css&hellip; none of that really showed what I was actually learning or even who I really became after entering the cybersec world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Then, in a video of my brother <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX2ADIIC5GYNERNSxSerKow">David</a>, I remembered that his guest Graham Helton (great guy) had a <a href="https://www.grahamhelton.com/">great website</a>!</p>
<p>So I took a look in the source code and there it was&hellip;</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">meta</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">name</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;generator&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">content</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Hugo 0.68.3&#34;</span>&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I searched for it a little bit and found out that Hugo was actually great for static websites. All I had to do was kinda renounce to all of the fancy christmasy images I liked so much.</p>
<p>Easy choice ^^</p>
<p>After some clicks and setups, got it up and running.
Super simple, super clean, super fast!</p>
<p>If you wanna try it yourself, I got some help from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjD9jTi_DQ4">this video here</a> ;)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Cheers,
