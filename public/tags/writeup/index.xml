      <description>Some things that were unsolved that I found out in the demo version :)
Target: OWASP Juice Shop
 Bully Chatbot&amp;nbsp;¶ You have to release your inner nagger and ask repeatedly for coupons :)
What worked for me was to type coupons +=1
 Repetitive Registration&amp;nbsp;¶ This one is pretty simple.
Fill out everything correctly, then go to the first &amp;ldquo;Password&amp;rdquo; field and change it.</description>

      <description>Hey, this is a simple writeup on the challenges provided by picoCTF
Hope you find it useful ;)
 Get aHEAD&amp;nbsp;¶ For this challenge you should think about the HTTP request methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD,&amp;hellip;)
See the HEAD there? Does it look like something you have on the title of the challenge? xP
The HEAD gives you the website&amp;rsquo;s metadata. It should do the same thing as a GET but without all the body, although sometimes they are different.</description>
