      <description>I had a fancy shmancy website with wordpress, and I was very proud! Nice pentest tooling logos, badges for showing off, great header image. But besides terrible loading times, 3 hours to set up a 2min reading time blog post or hard time customizing css&amp;hellip; none of that really showed what I was actually learning or even who I really became after entering the cybersec world.
Â Then, in a video of my brother David, I remembered that his guest Graham Helton (great guy) had a great website!</description>
